### Results
{: #cloud_modern_bundle_orderinginstance-results}

The deployment of the instance starts automatically and the on-premises HCX on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} service activation key is ordered.

#### Deployment process for HCX on IBM Cloud
{: #cloud_modern_bundle_orderinginstance-hcx-deploy-process}

The deployment of HCX on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} is automated. The following steps are completed by the {{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_short}} automation process:
1. Three subnets are ordered for HCX from the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} infrastructure:
   * Two private portable subnets for HCX management.
   * One public portable subnet for activation and maintenance with VMware. This subnet is also used for HCX interconnects.

   The IP addresses in the subnets that are ordered for HCX are intended to be managed by the VMware on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} automation. These IP addresses cannot be assigned to VMware resources, such as VMs and NSX Edges, that are created by you. If you need more IP addresses for your VMware artifacts, you must order your own subnets from {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}.
   {:important}
3. Three resource pools and VM folders for HCX are created, which are needed for the HCX interconnects, local HCX components, and remote HCX components.
4. A pair of VMware NSX Edge Services Gateways (ESGs) for the HCX management traffic is deployed and configured:
   * Public and private uplink interfaces are configured by using the ordered subnets.
   * The ESGs are configured as a pair of extra large edge appliances with High Availability (HA) enabled.
   * The firewall rules and network address translation (NAT) rules are configured to allow inbound and outbound HTTPS traffic to and from the HCX Manager.
   * The load balancer rules and resource pools are configured. These rules and resource pools are used to forward HCX-related inbound traffic to the appropriate virtual appliances of HCX Manager and vCenter Server (with embedded Platform Services Controller).
   * An SSL certificate to encrypt the HCX-related inbound HTTPS traffic that is coming through the ESGs is applied.

   The HCX management edge is dedicated to the HCX management traffic between the on-premises HCX components and the cloud-side HCX components. Do not modify the HCX management edge or use it for HCX network extensions. Instead, create separate edges for network extensions. In addition, by using a firewall or disabling the HCX management edge communications to the private IBM management components or public internet might adversely impact the HCX functionality.
   {:important}

5. The HCX Manager on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} is deployed, activated, and configured:
   * The HCX Manager is registered with vCenter Server.
   * The HCX Manager, vCenter Server (with embedded Platform Services Controller), and NSX Manager are configured.
   * The HCX fleet is configured.
   * Local and remote HCX deployment containers are configured.
6. The host name and IP address of the HCX Manager is registered with the DNS server of VMware vCenter Server on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}.

#### Viewing instance details
{: #cloud_modern_bundle_orderinginstance-view-inst-details}

You can check the status of the deployment by viewing the instance details. Click **Resources** from the left navigation pane and locate the **vCenter Server Instances** or **On-premises HCX Instances** table to view information about the instances that you ordered.

When the instance is successfully deployed, the components that are described in the *Technical specifications* sections of this topic are installed on your VMware virtual platform and the on-premises HCX on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} service activation key is listed in the **On-premises HCX Instances** table.

The status of the instance changes to **Ready to Use** and you receive a notification by email.

## Procedure to delete Single-node Trial for Migration and App Modernization instances
{: #cloud_modern_bundle_orderinginstance-deleting-procedure}

When you delete a Single-node Trial for Migration and App Modernization instance, the following components are released sequentially:

1. All deployed services
3. VMware product licenses
4. ESXi servers
5. Subnets
6. VLANs

Because of resource dependencies, the components in your instance are not released immediately when you delete the instance. For example, the subnets and VLANs cannot be deleted until the ESXi servers are fully reclaimed by {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} infrastructure, which happens at the end of the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} infrastructure billing cycle. At the end of the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} infrastructure billing cycle, which is typically 30 days, the subnets and VLANs are deleted and the instance deletion is completed.

You are billed until the end of the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} infrastructure billing cycle for the deleted instance.
{:note}

Complete the following steps to delete a Single-node Trial for Migration and App Modernization instance:

1. From the {{site.data.keyword.vmwaresolutions_short}} console, click **Resources** from the left navigation pane.
2. In the **vCenter Server Instances** table, find the instance to delete.
3. In the **Actions** column, click the Delete icon.
